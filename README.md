# unshaped-godot-2dplatformer

This is a small Godot v4 project to demonstrate how to maintain state across scenes, I'm using a 2D Platformer as a sample game type as they often have multiple levels.

Basic code based on a course I took on Zenva: https://academy.zenva.com/course/create-a-2d-platformer-with-godot-4/

Assets from Kenney, Platformer Assets Base and Audio. You can download the full asset set here: https://kenney.itch.io/kenney-game-assets and check out all of Kenney's stuff here: https://kenney.nl
